      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello, My name is Matt. I was in the Navy for 4 years, then I went to Kennesaw State University and got my Bachelor's and Master's degrees
        in Information Systems. My background is really desktop support. I've had CompTIA A+, Network+, and Security+ certs.
        I also had Cisco CCNA routing and switching and CCNA Security certs as well. 
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in the metro area of Atlanta, GA. I moved to Dallas, Texas in March of 2017 to be with my wife.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>The NFL and Pokemon Go</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Being a father. I think I'd make a great one. Professionally speaking, I don't have a dream job. I just want to like what I do.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>McKinney, Texas</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Better pay and growth opportunities. I was in desktop support for years and it's a dead end with low pay. I've also grown impatient
        with people who don't understand the basics of a computer in 2021. The truth is programming will make me crtically think a lot, and 
        I like that very much. Plus I can meet and work with different people and learn some new tricks along the way.
